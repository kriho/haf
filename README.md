# HAF
a **h**olistic **a**pplication **f**ramework for WPF based MVVM applications

This framework aims to make the most of the MVVM pattern by
- providing a service based approach to implement the application logic
- allowing a systematic description of service dependencies and service states
- using MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework) for service injection
- providing full application extensibility
- improving the design time experience by declaring design time data on a service level
- already providing a large set of services for default application logic
- implementing most missing MVVM related classes such as the RelayCommand and the ObservableObject

The Telerik UI for WPF library is required to use the template features of this framework.
